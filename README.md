# IBM-Ready-App-for-Insurance


##Overview

IBM Ready App for Insurance is the fourth of the IBM Ready App Series.


This app
* mitigates risks for insurance providers and increases policy holder loyalty
* improves relationships between homeowners and insurance providers
* connects users with their homes
* takes advantage of modern utility systems


Users are able to stay connected to their homes by syncing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors with select utility systems in their homes with the help of Insurance Providers. In turn, IBM Ready App for Insurance provides real time detailed information from the data it receives from these sensors, keeps track of a users' normal daily consumption levels, and notifies users if selected utility systems reach abnormal levels.
