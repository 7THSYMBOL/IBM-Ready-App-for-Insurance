# IBM-Ready-App-for-Insurance

##Overview

The 4th ReadyApp, IBM Ready App for Insurance focuses on improving the relationship between homeowners and their homeowners insurance providers. Through the help of insurance providers, users are able to stay connected to their homes by syncing Internet of Things (IoT) sensors with select utility systems in their homes. It aims at mitigating risk for the insurance provider and in turn, increasing loyalty from their policy holders. IBM Ready App for Insurance provides real time detailed information from the data it receives from these sensors and keeps track of a userâ€™s normal daily consumption and provides notifications if the selected utility systems reach abnormal levels.
